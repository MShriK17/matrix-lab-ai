# 🧠 MatrixLab AI

> An interactive Streamlit-based platform for Data Analysis, Machine Learning model training, visualization, and real-time predictions — all in one place.

---

## 📖 About The Project

**MatrixLab AI** is an all-in-one web application designed to make data analysis and machine learning more accessible.  
Built with **Streamlit**, it allows users to upload datasets, perform automated **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, train machine learning models, visualize data, and generate predictions — all through an intuitive web interface, without writing a single line of code.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 **EDA & Visualization**  
  - Upload datasets in CSV format.  
  - Auto-generate descriptive statistics and beautiful visualizations using Plotly, Seaborn, Altair, and Matplotlib.

- 🤖 **Model Training Studio**  
  - Train Classification & Regression models with custom parameters.  
  - Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics and visual charts.

- 📁 **Batch & Real-time Predictions**  
  - Make predictions using uploaded CSV files or via manual input fields.

- 🧰 **Modular Architecture**  
  - Easy to extend with new ML models, visualizations, or features.

- 🌐 **Cloud Deployment**  
  - Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for instant access anywhere.
